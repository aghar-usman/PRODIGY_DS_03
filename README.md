# Decision Tree Classification on Bank Marketing Dataset 🌳📊

This repository contains the implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, based on the **Bank Marketing Dataset**. The dataset includes various features such as age, job, marital status, and past campaign contacts.

## 📋 **Project Overview:**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and encoded categorical features for machine learning models.
- **Model Training**: Built and trained a **Decision Tree** model using the `entropy` criterion.
- **Model Evaluation**: 
  - **Accuracy**: 88.49%
  - **Classification Report** 📑
  - **Confusion Matrix** 🤖
  - **ROC Curve & AUC Score** 📉
- **Feature Importance**: Visualized the impact of each feature on the model’s predictions 🔑

## 🛠️ **Tools & Libraries Used:**
- **Python** 🐍
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `graphviz` (for visualizing decision trees)
  
## 📥 **How to Use:**
